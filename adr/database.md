# Choosing which database to use

## Status
Postgres accepted

## Context
We looked at
- Postgres
- Mysql
- mongodb

## Decision
Mongodb is not viable because you always need an internet connection to access mongo.
MySql does not offer the options we require to manipulate the database
Postgres is DA BOMB!

## Consequences
We know which database we will use for our project, and can therefore start working on the backend
